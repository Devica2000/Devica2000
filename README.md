### Hi there! 👋

<!--
**Devica2000/Devica2000** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I'm **Devica** (not device). It is nice to e-meet you!😊

Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist after graduating with a Master's Degree in Computer Science (Machine Learning Track) from Columbia University. I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. My goal is to leverage technology as an enabler to solve problems prevailing in the society.  

I enjoy organizing, participating, and volunteering at different events. When not immersed in data and tech, you'll find me dancing, singing, swimming or engrossed in a good book.💃🏊‍♀️

Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate and share insights!✨

Here is what I am upto:

- 🔭 I currently build end-to-end Machine Learning systems at scale (Especially for Product Ranking)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to productionize ML models (Feel free to share any best practices!)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with building my portfolio.
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born on International Women's Day!
